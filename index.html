			<h2>About</h2>

			<p>
				<em>Note: If you’re not me, you’re unlikely to have much use for this Inflector.</em>
			</p>

			<p>
				<a href="https://www.velut.co.uk/">velut</a> is my Latin rhyming dictionary.
				All the data for this are stored in Json files on my computer.
				For example, I have a list of lemmata (dictionary headwords), stored as an array of Json objects.
				The purpose of the Inflector is to read from the list of lemmata, generate the inflected forms for each lemma, and write them to my hard disk for further processing.
				I do this by running <a href="https://github.com/DuncanRitchie/velut-inflector/blob/main/inflector.js">the inflector.js script</a> in Node.
			</p>

			<p>
				But I also made this webpage, to demonstrate what the Inflector does.
				You can input several lemmata (as Json) in the first box, click “Generate forms”, and see the output in the second box.
				The resultant Json can be downloaded or copied to the clipboard.
			</p>

			<p>
				I made the Inflector so I could avoid adding inflected forms manually to velut — I can make my code generate them all, and I can correct the code or the input data if I need to.
				It was a lot of work, codifying so much of Latin morphology into JavaScript, but it’s better than continuing the way I was.
			</p>

			<p>
				Now I have made the Inflector (and have manually checked the forms it produces), the website uses those forms instead of the manually-added forms. There were 124,649 words in the dictionary when I was adding words manually. It now has over two million.
			</p>

			<h3 id="input-format">Input format</h3>

			<p>
				The input needs to be a Json array of objects.
				Each object must have the string fields of <code>Lemma</code> and <code>PartOfSpeech</code>.
				Additionally, the Inflector also looks for some <em>optional</em> fields, which can override aspects of the Inflector’s default behaviour.
				(However, not all of these apply to all parts of speech.)
			</p>

			<dl>
				<dt><code>"ComparativeStems"</code></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						String array of stems for the comparative forms of adjectives and adverbs.
					</p>
				</dd>

				<dt><code>"Conjugations"</code></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						Integer array (for regular verbs) or string array (for irregular verbs).
						Potential values are <samp>[1]</samp>, <samp>[2]</samp>, <samp>[3]</samp>, <samp>[4]</samp>, <samp>["dō"]</samp>, <samp>["eō"]</samp>, <samp>["faciō"]</samp>, <samp>["ferō"]</samp>, <samp>["sum"]</samp>.
					</p>
					<p>
						(The value <samp>["dō"]</samp> means the verb declines like <q lang="la">dō</q> and <q lang="la">circumdō</q> — <q lang="la">dō/dare/dedī/datum</q>.
						It should not be used for verbs like <q lang="la">addō</q> and <q lang="la">condō</q> — which are regular 3rd-conjugation verbs, as <q lang="la">addō/addere/addidī/additum</q>.)
					</p>
					<p>
						If a verb has more than one possible conjugation, I have it as more than one lemma.
						So it is unlikely that any lemma will ever have more than one value in <code>"Conjugations"</code>.
						This property is an array in case I change my mind on that, and for consistency with <code>"Declensions"</code> and other array properties.
					</p>
				</dd>

				<dt><code>"Declensions"</code></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						An integer array for nouns and adjectives; adjectives can have the following —
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<samp>[1, 2]</samp> is for 1st/2nd-declension adjectives (1st declension for feminine, 2nd declension for masculine and neuter).
						</li>
						<li>
							<samp>[3]</samp> is for 3rd-declension adjectives.
						</li>
						<li>
							<samp>[0]</samp> means the lemma is indeclinable: all forms are the same as the lemma form.
							Comparative and superlative forms are not generated.
						</li>
						<li>
							<samp>[1]</samp> is used for <q lang="la">rūricola</q> and <q lang="la">terrigena</q>, which follow the 1st declension for <em>both</em> the feminine and the masculine (both adjectives happen to have no neuter).
							Comparative and superlative forms are not generated.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						(Whenever adjective lemmata are labelled as belonging to the 1st/2nd declension or the 3rd declension, this only really describes the positive forms.
						Comparative forms will have 3rd-declension endings and superlative forms will have 1st/2nd-declension endings, regardless of the declension of the rest of the adjective.)
					</p>
					<p>
						For nouns (including proper nouns), the <code>"Declensions"</code> array can contain any integer from <samp>0</samp> to <samp>5</samp>.
						It is possible to have more than one declension.
						For example, <samp>[2, 4]</samp> produces both 2nd-declension and 4th-declension forms (eg for <q lang="la">domus</q>), and <samp>[0, 3]</samp> produces both indeclinable forms and 3rd-declension forms (eg for <q lang="la">Iōb</q>).
					</p>
				</dd>

				<dt><code>"ExtraEncliticizedForms"</code></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						Object of forms to add to whatever the Inflector generates itself, after enclitics have been added.
					</p>
					<p>
						My main use of this is when I find that some of the forms that I had added to velut manually are incorrect.
						Since I want the Inflector to generate all the forms that were already in velut, I put these incorrect forms in an array — <code>"ExtraEncliticizedForms": { "incorrect": [] }</code> — so they get copied into the output data, but are easy to ignore.
					</p>
					<p>
						Otherwise, this field is used for some irregular contractions of words in “-ne”.
						For example, it’s used on the adjective <q lang="la">tantus</q>, to make <q lang="la">tantōn</q> appear alongside <q lang="la">tantōne</q>.
					</p>
				</dd>

				<dt><code>"ExtraForms"</code></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						Object of forms to add to whatever the Inflector generates itself, before any enclitics are added to the result.
					</p>
				</dd>

				<dt><code>"Forms"</code></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						Object of forms to use instead of anything the Inflector would generate itself.
						But if the object does not have <code>"unencliticized"</code> (or <code>"ne"</code> or <code>"que"</code> or <code>"ve"</code>) as a field at root, encliticized forms will be generated from anything in the <code>"Forms"</code> object.
						(However, enclitics are not added for interjections, conjunctions that lack <samp>"Forms": true</samp>, and anything with <samp>"ParsingsToExclude": ["ne", "que", "ve"]</samp>.)
					</p>
				</dd>

				<dt><code>"FutureActiveParticipleStems"</code></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						String array of stems for the future active participle forms of verbs of the 1st, 3rd, or 4th conjugation.
						For example, the array is <samp>["morit"]</samp> for <q lang="la">morior</q>, so the participle forms are <q lang="la">moritūrus</q> etc.
						If this is not specified (or the verb is not of the 1st, 3rd, or 4th conjugation), the supine stems are used — either the value of <code>"SupineStems"</code> or a regularly-generated fallback.
					</p>
				</dd>

				<dt><code>"GerundVowels"</code></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						String array of vowels to use before the “nd” in gerunds and gerundives for verbs of the 3rd, 4th, or <q lang="la">faciō</q> conjugation.
						For example, the array is <samp>["e", "u"]</samp> for <q lang="la">gerō</q>, so the gerundive forms are <q lang="la">gerendus/gerundus</q> etc.
						If this is not specified (or the verb is not of the 3rd or 4th conjugation), the default is <samp>["e"]</samp>.
						The only lemmata that currently have this are <q lang="la">faciō</q> and <q lang="la">gerō</q>; curiously one of the few verbs in Latin with an irregular gerund is the source of the word “gerund”.
					</p>
					<p>
						(I previously considered <q lang="la">orior</q> as a verb with <samp>"GerundVowels": ["u"]</samp>.
						But <q lang="la">oriundus</q> should be an adjective meaning “originating from”, not a gerund or gerundive.)
					</p>
				</dd>

				<dt><code>"HasArchaicInfinitiveInIer"</code></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						Boolean for whether a verb should have a present passive (or active if deponent) infinitive ending with “-ier”, potentially in addition to one in “-ī”.
					</p>
				</dd>

				<dt><code>"HasIStem"</code></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						Boolean for whether a 3rd-declension adjective or 3rd-declension noun should follow the “i-stem” paradigm.
					</p>
					<p>
						This may not need to be explicitly set to true or false for all 3rd-declension lemmata.
						For example, if <code>HasThreeTerminations</code> is true (for an adjective), <code>HasIStem</code> is treated as true by default.
					</p>
				</dd>

				<dt><code>"HasLocative"</code></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						Boolean for whether a noun (proper or otherwise) should get a locative form, or for whether a 1st/2nd-declension adjective should get locative forms.
					</p>
					<p>
						Most nouns that get the locative have either singular forms and no plural (eg <q lang="la">Rōma</q>, locative singular <q lang="la">Rōmae</q>) or plural forms and no singular (eg <q lang="la">Athēnae</q>, locative plural <q lang="la">Athēnīs</q>).
						Nouns that exist in both singular and plural (eg <q lang="la">domus</q>) will get the locative for the singular only.
					</p>
					<p>
						The only adjectives I mark with <code>"HasLocative": true</code> are the possessives: <q lang="la">meus</q>, <q lang="la">tuus</q>, <q lang="la">suus</q>, <q lang="la">noster</q>, <q lang="la">voster</q>, <q lang="la">vester</q>, <q lang="la">aliēnus</q>.
						These all belong to the 1st/2nd declension.
						They will get the locative for all three genders in both singular and plural, but only for the positive degree.
						(The adjective <q lang="la">aliēnus</q> is not attested in the locative comparative/superlative; the other adjectives have no comparative or superlative at all.
						Theoretically “in the Athens of complete strangers” could be translated as <q lang="la">Athēnīs aliēnissimīs</q>, for example, but I’m not allowing that without attestation.)
					</p>
				</dd>

				<dt><code>"HasPerfectActiveParticiple"</code></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						Boolean for whether perfect <em>active</em> participles should be generated for non-deponent verbs, potentially in addition to impersonal perfect passive participles.
						If this property is not specified, the default is <code>false</code>.
					</p>
					<p>
						For example, <q lang="la">ārdeō</q> has <code>"HasPerfectActiveParticiple": true</code> because <q lang="la">ārsus</q> can mean “having burnt”.
						Likewise, <q lang="la">exolēscō</q> has <code>"HasPerfectActiveParticiple": true</code> because <q lang="la">exolētus</q> can mean “having obsolesced” (ie, “obsolete”).
					</p>
					<p>
						This property has no effect on deponent verbs, semi-deponent verbs, or parts of speech other than verbs.
						Deponent and semi-deponent verbs have perfect active participles anyway.
					</p>
					<p>
						Transitive non-deponent verbs have perfect <em>passive</em> participles, but <code>"HasPerfectActiveParticiple"</code> can still be used to create perfect active participles, which will look the same as the passive ones.
						Examples of transitive non-deponent verbs with both passive and active perfect participles are <q lang="la">fleō</q> and <q lang="la">taceō</q>.
					</p>
				</dd>

				<dt><code>"HasPerfectPassiveParticiple"</code></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						Boolean for whether perfect <em>passive</em> participles should be generated for deponent or semi-deponent verbs, potentially in addition to perfect active participles.
						If this property is not specified, the default is <code>false</code>.
					</p>
					<p>
						For example, <q lang="la">effor</q> has <code>"HasPerfectPassiveParticiple": true</code> because <q lang="la">haec verba effāta sunt</q> can mean “they [neuter plural] spoke these words” (active) or “these words were spoken” (passive).
					</p>
					<p>
						This property has no effect on non-deponent verbs or other parts of speech — the perfect participles of non-deponent verbs are passive regardless.
					</p>
				</dd>

				<dt><code>"HasSyncopatedPerfectForms"</code></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						Boolean for whether perfect-system forms should include syncopation — which would occur when a verb of the main four conjugations has a perfect stem ending in -āv-, -ēv-, -īv, or -ōv-.
						For example, <q lang="la">amāsse</q> is a valid variant of <q lang="la">amāvisse</q>, so the lemma <q lang="la">amō</q> could have <code>"HasSyncopatedPerfectForms": true</code>.
						But <q lang="la">lāvisse</q> cannot be contracted to <q lang="la">lāsse</q>, and likewise for the other lāv- forms, so <q lang="la">lavō</q> has <code>"HasSyncopatedPerfectForms": false</code>.
					</p>
					<p>
						(Theoretically you could argue that <q lang="la">lāvisse</q> is itself a syncopated form, since the regular perfect infinitive would be <q lang="la">lavāvisse</q>.
						But the long form doesn’t exist, and indeed there are no attestations of lavāv- in Latin, and the regular syncopation of <q lang="la">lavāvisse</q> would be <q lang="la">lavāsse</q> not <q lang="la">lāvisse</q>.
						So it’s cleaner for me to specify the lāv- as a custom stem in <code>"PerfectStems"</code>, and have a <code>"HasSyncopatedPerfectForms"</code> field to stop unwanted forms like <q lang="la">lāsse</q> being created.)
					</p>
					<p>
						Syncopation on -ōv- is used for <q lang="la">moveō</q> and some of its compounds.
						It makes <q lang="la">mōrunt</q> appear alongside <q lang="la">mōvērunt</q> and <q lang="la">remōsse</q> appear alongside <q lang="la">remōvisse</q>, for example.
						Syncopation on -ōv- is also used on <q lang="la">nōscō</q> and its compounds.
					</p>
					<p>
						Syncopation happens when the grammatical ending begins with -er-, -ēr-, or -is-.
						For example, <q lang="la">amāverant</q> to <q lang="la">amārant</q>, <q lang="la">amāvērunt</q> to <q lang="la">amārunt</q>, and <q lang="la">amāvistī</q> to <q lang="la">amāstī</q>.
						However, I do not allow syncopation on stems ending in -īv- when the ending begins with -er- or -ēr-, because I can find but one attestation of this (<a href="https://latin.packhum.org/loc/119/4/8/3793-3800"><q lang="la">sīrint</q></a> for <q lang="la">sīverint</q> in Plautus).
						So <q lang="la">quaerō</q> has <q lang="la">quaesīvisse</q> contracting to <q lang="la">quaesīsse</q>, but <q lang="la">quaesīverō</q> has no contraction.
					</p>
					<p>
						If the <code>"HasSyncopatedPerfectForms"</code> field is omitted, 1st-conjugation verbs will receive syncopated forms by default if a perfect stem ends in -āv-, 2nd-conjugation verbs will receive syncopated forms by default if a perfect stem ends in -ēv-, 3rd-conjugation verbs will receive syncopated forms by default if a perfect stem ends in -ōv-, and 4th-conjugation verbs will receive syncopated forms by default if a perfect stem ends in -īv-.
					</p>
					<p>
						If syncopated forms are being created, with a stem ending in -īv as well as a stem ending in -i, the resulting forms will include an unsyncopated -īv- form, an -i- form, and a syncopated form.
						This happens by default for the 4th conjugation.
						For example, <q lang="la">audiō</q> does not have custom <code>"HasSyncopatedPerfectForms"</code> or <code>"PerfectStems"</code> fields in my source data, so the perfect stems will be audīv- and audi-, and the second-person singular perfect active indicative forms will be <q lang="la">audīvistī</q>, <q lang="la">audiistī</q>, <q lang="la">audīstī</q>.
						(This only happens with endings that begin with -is-, because as noted above I do not allow syncopation that would produce -īr- from -īver- or -īvēr-.)
					</p>
					<p>
						The<code>"HasSyncopatedPerfectForms"</code> field has an effect on verbs of the main four conjugations only.
					</p>
				</dd>

				<dt><code>"HasThreeTerminations"</code></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						Boolean for whether a 3rd-declension adjective has different forms for all three genders of the nominative singular.
						For example, <q lang="la">ācer</q> (<q lang="la">ācer/ācris/ācre</q>) and <q lang="la">celer</q> (<q lang="la">celer/celeris/celere</q>).
					</p>
				</dd>

				<dt><code>"IsDeclinedLikeAdjective"</code></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						Boolean that is true for 3rd-declension nouns that are declined like an adjective with ablative singular in “-ī” and genitive plural in “-ium”.
					</p>
				</dd>

				<dt><code>"IsGreekFirstDeclension"</code></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						Boolean that is true for 1st-declension nouns that have their accusative singular in “-ēn”, genitive singular in “-ēs”, and ablative singular in “-ē”.
					</p>
				</dd>

				<dt><code>"IsGreekThirdDeclensionInOmega"</code></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						Boolean that is true for feminine nouns, derived from Greek proper nouns, that have identical forms in the nominative/vocative/accusative/dative/ablative, genitive singular in “-ūs”, and no plural or locative.
					</p>
					<p>
						Examples include <q lang="la">Clīō</q>, <q lang="la">Ēchō</q>, and <q lang="la">Sapphō</q>.
						There’s also <q lang="la">ēchō</q>, which is simply  <q lang="la">Ēchō</q> as a non-proper noun.
						These should all end in “-ō” in the non-genitive forms.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Inflector will not generate masculine, neuter, locative, or plural forms of these words.
					</p>
				</dd>

				<dt><code>"IsImpersonal"</code></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						Boolean that is true for verbs that only have third-person singular forms (besides infinitives etc), such as <q lang="la">grandinat</q> and <q lang="la">oportet</q>.
					</p>
				</dd>

				<dt><code>"IsIntransitive"</code></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						Boolean that is true for verbs whose only passive forms are impersonal (third-person singular), such as <q lang="la">eō</q>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Deponent verbs do not have impersonal passive forms, nor any passive forms except gerundives (passive future participles) and ablative supines (if ablative supines can be considered passive).
						But they do have gerundives that are passive — they have the same distinction between active future participles in “-ūrus” and passive future participles in “-ndus” that non-deponent verbs have.
						Therefore deponent verbs can be classed as transitive or intransitive, too.
					</p>
					<p>
						An intransitive deponent verb may get impersonal gerundives (eg <q lang="la">moriendum</q>), but not the full suite of gerundives (like a transitive verb would).
						Intransitive verbs do not get the ablative supine, but transitive verbs do.
						These two differences are the only differences between a transitive deponent verb and an intransitive deponent verb, at least with regard to the forms generated by the Inflector.
					</p>
					<p>
						Very reasonably, scholarly convention describes supines as accusative (ending in “-um”) or ablative (ending in “-ū”), and those are the labels the Inflector applies.
						It doesn’t label them as active or passive.
						My idea is that ablative supines are passive and therefore should not exist for intransitive verbs; this is not entirely unreasonable when considering expressions such as <q lang="la">sermō mīrābilis dictū</q> (“a speech marvellous in being said”).
						Admittedly some would consider <q lang="la">nātū</q> to be the ablative supine for the intransitive <q lang="la">nāscor</q>, and the supine in Statius’ <q lang="la">vēnātū reditūrum opperiēns</q> (“waiting for him to return from the hunt”) is no more passive than <q lang="la">vēnātum īre</q> (“to go to hunt”).
						And ablative supines are not actually attested for many verbs, even the transitive ones.
						But I still like to create ablative supines for transitive verbs and withhold them for intransitive verbs.
						(I can make an exemption for <q lang="la">nātū</q>.)
					</p>
					<p>
						All verbs of the <q lang="la">sum</q> conjugation are intransitive.
						The <code>"IsIntransitive"</code> field has no effect on them.
					</p>
				</dd>

				<dt><code>"IsLemmaInQue"</code></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						Boolean for whether the lemma’s forms end in grammatical endings followed by “-que”, such as <q lang="la">plērusque</q> and <q lang="la">uterque</q>. Such lemmata have no encliticized forms: the “-que” suffix does not mean “and”.
					</p>
				</dd>

				<dt><code>"IsPresentParticiple"</code></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						Boolean that is true for an adjective lemma representing a present participle (ending in “-āns” or “ēns”) for a <em>non-existent</em> verb.
						Present participles receive ablative singular forms in both “-e” and “-ī”.
					</p>
					<p>
						So <q lang="la">inciēns</q> has <code>"IsPresentParticiple": true</code> because it (at least supposedly) derives from the verb <q lang="la">incieō</q> as its present participle, but <q lang="la">incieō</q> doesn’t exist in its own right.
						Thus it differs from <q lang="la">ingēns</q>, which ends in “-ēns” but is not a participle.
					</p>
					<p>
						Why are some participles made into their own lemmata, other than because the verb doesn’t exist?
						Forms for verb lemmata do not include comparative or superlative forms — they are not “graded”.
						If a participle is to be given comparative or superlative forms, I make it its own lemma, as an adjective.
					</p>
					<p>
						Therefore, <q lang="la">amantī</q> is given as the ablative singular masculine/feminine/neuter positive form of an adjective lemma <q lang="la">amāns</q> (which has positive, comparative, and superlative forms, but does <em>not</em> have <code>"IsPresentParticiple": true</code>). The forms <q lang="la">amante</q> and <q lang="la">amantī</q> are the ablative singular masculine/feminine/neuter present participle forms of the verb lemma <q lang="la">amō</q>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Inside the Inflector, present participle forms of verbs are generated as if they belonged to an adjective lemma with <code>"IsPresentParticiple": true</code>.
						This doesn’t affect the input lemmata data.
					</p>
				</dd>

				<dt><code>"IsSemiDeponent"</code></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						Boolean that is true for verbs such as <q lang="la">gaudeō</q> that are non-deponent in present-system tenses (present, imperfect, future) and deponent in perfect-system tenses (perfect, pluperfect, future perfect).
						These verbs have no passive forms except participles.
					</p>
				</dd>

				<dt><code>"ObliqueStems"</code></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						String array, for adjectives, adverbs, and nouns.
						It represents the stems to use for oblique (ie, non-lemma) forms.
						For example, <q lang="la">āctiō’</q> has <samp>["āctiōn"]</samp> and <q lang="la">vetus</q> has <samp>["veter"]</samp>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Most adjectives/adverbs/nouns have only one oblique stem.
						<code>"ObliqueStems"</code> is not needed if the lemma has one oblique stem and it can be easily deduced from the lemma form.
					</p>
					<p>
						Adjectives and adverbs can get comparative and superlative forms.
						Comparative forms and superlative forms are generated from <code>"ObliqueStems"</code> if the fields <code>"ComparativeStems"</code> and <code>"SuperlativeStems"</code> are not specified (respectively).
					</p>
					<p>
						More precisely — if <code>"ComparativeStems"</code> is not specified, the comparative stems are the oblique stems plus “i”, which will then be combined with the endings “-or”, “-or”, “-us” etc.
						Likewise, if <code>"SuperlativeStems"</code> is not specified, the superlative stems are the oblique stems plus “issim”, which will then be combined with the regular 1st/2nd-declension endings “-us”, “-a”, “-um” etc.
					</p>
				</dd>

				<dt><code>"ParsingsToExclude"</code></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						String array, eg <samp>["comparative", "superlative"]</samp> for an adjective/adverb that does not have any comparative or superlative forms.
					</p>
					<p>
						To remove forms at the <em>intersection</em> of multiple grammatical labels, <code>"ReplacementForms"</code> or <code>"ReplacementEncliticizedForms"</code> can be used with an empty array in a nested object.
						For example, <samp>"ReplacementForms": { "participle": { "active": { "future": [] } } }</samp> means that the lemma will not have any future active participles.
						For this to work, the nesting must match what the Inflector would generate.
						(<samp>"ReplacementForms": { "future": { "active": { "participle": [] } } }</samp> does nothing.)
					</p>
				</dd>

				<dt><code>"PerfectStems"</code></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						String array of stems for the perfect forms of non-deponent verbs, eg <samp>["sonu"]</samp> for <q lang="la">sonō</q> (so the perfect forms are <q lang="la">sonuī</q> etc, not the regular <q lang="la">sonāvī</q>).
					</p>
					<p>
						If this is not set, the default perfect stems are such that the following forms are produced: <q lang="la">amāvī</q>, <q lang="la">monuī</q>, <q lang="la">cansī</q>, <q lang="la">audīvī, audiī</q>, for the main four conjugations respectively.
						In the case of the 3rd conjugation, a warning will be logged to the console if <code>"PerfectStems"</code> is not set, since I expect the default to be nonsense, as indeed my example here of <q lang="la">cansī</q> is!
					</p>
					<p>
						The <code>"PerfectStems"</code> field only applies to non-deponent verbs.
						Deponent/semi-deponent verbs use constructions such as <q lang="la">locūtus sum</q> for the (active) perfect — using the perfect participle, which is formed from the supine stems and not any “perfect stems”.
						(And the Inflector doesn’t even produce <q lang="la">locūtus sum</q> as a form.
						It doesn’t generate forms consisting of more than one word, so it produces <q lang="la">locūtus</q> for the perfect participle but not <q lang="la">locūtus sum</q>.)
					</p>
				</dd>

				<dt><code>"ReceivesEnclitics"</code></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						Boolean that is true for conjunctions that have encliticized forms, such as <q lang="la">cum</q> because <q lang="la">cumque</q> and <q lang="la">cumve</q> are attested.
					</p>
					<p>
						Words other than conjunctions and interjections receive enclitics by default; this field is not needed and has no effect on them.
						It is unlikely that interjections can ever be encliticized.
					</p>
				</dd>

				<dt><code>"ReplacementEncliticizedForms"</code></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						Object of forms to use instead of the regularly generated forms for the parsings that are specified, after enclitics have been added.
						For example, it is used on the adjective <q lang="la">suus</q>, to make <q lang="la">süāve</q> appear instead of <q lang="la">suāve</q>.
						(This is to differentiate from the <q lang="la">suāve</q> that is a form of <q lang="la">suāvis</q> with consonantal u.)
					</p>
				</dd>

				<dt><code>"ReplacementForms"</code></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						Object of forms to use instead of the regularly generated forms for the parsings that are specified, before any enclitics are added to the result.
					</p>
					<p>
						For example, <samp>"ReplacementForms": { "positive": { "masculine": { "singular": { "vocative": ["mī"] } } } }</samp> results in the vocative singular masculine positive form being <q lang="la">mī</q> instead of whatever the Inflector would create regularly (which would be the incorrect <q lang="la">mee</q> in this case, for the lemma <q lang="la">meus</q>).
					</p>
				</dd>

				<dt><code>"SuperlativeStems"</code></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						String array of stems for the superlative forms of adjectives and adverbs.
					</p>
				</dd>

				<dt><code>"SupineStems"</code></dt>
				<dd>
					<p>
						String array of stems for the supine and perfect participle forms of verbs, eg <samp>["sonit"]</samp> for <q lang="la">sonō</q> (so the participle forms are <q lang="la">sonitus</q> etc, not the regular <q lang="la">sonātus</q>).
					</p>
					<p>
						If this is not set, the default supine stems are such that the following forms are produced: <q lang="la">amātum</q>, <q lang="la">monitum</q>, <q lang="la">cantum</q>, <q lang="la">audītum</q>, for the main four conjugations respectively.
						In the case of the 3rd conjugation, a warning will be logged to the console if <code>"SupineStems"</code> is not set, since the default is likely to be nonsense.
						(Even if the default is correct for a 3rd-conjugation verb, as my example here of <q lang="la">cantum</q> is, I still find it reassuring to set <code>"SupineStems"</code> specifically.)

			<h3>The velut Excel file</h3>

			<p>
				The velut website uses a MongoDB database, and this page produces Json data that could go into the MongoDB database.
				But I privately have a large Excel file that I used for generating and storing the data in velut.
				This is far from ideal, so I’ve been replacing the Excel file with Json files and JavaScript scripts.
			</p>

			<p>
				Happily, I can now avoid using Excel for velut, because of my new scripts and Json files.
			</p>

			<p>
				In the Excel file, I added inflected forms manually, without generating them through a script like the Inflector.
				I couldn’t add all the forms possible for every lemma.
				Also, I couldn’t have grammatical data — eg <q lang="la">amās</q> is in as a form of <q lang="la">amō</q>, but nothing says it’s the second-person singular present active indicative.
				Another motivation behind making the Inflector was to lessen a risk that I might add forms incorrectly.
			</p>

			<p>
				(Theoretically I could have had all forms and all the grammatical data, but it would have been <em>extremely</em> impractical.)
			</p>

			<p>
				One more downside of Excel is that it’s difficult to use version-control tools like Git with it.
			</p>

			<h3>Version control</h3>

			<p>
				I track the Json data-files in Git so I can check whether a change to my code has (inadvertently or deliberately) altered the output.
				But I don’t track the file that contains all the output — it’s huge.
				Instead, the Node-only code splits the data into batches of 1,000 lemmata and saves the batches as files, and Git tracks those files.
			</p>

			<h3>Ambiguously stressed forms</h3>

			<p>
				There exist pairs of forms in Latin which are spelt and macronized the same, but which are stressed on different syllables.
				For example <q lang="la">dominī</q> is stressed on the do- when it’s a form of <q lang="la">dominus</q>, but it’s stressed on the -mi- when it’s a form of <q lang="la">dominium</q>.
			</p>

			<p>
				The Node-only code looks for coincidences like this, and applies an acute accent to the form that’s stressed on the penult.
				Hence, we get <q lang="la">dominī</q> in the forms of <q lang="la">dominus</q> and <q lang="la">domínī</q> in the forms of <q lang="la">dominium</q>.
			</p>

			<p>
				This enables velut to handle the different forms properly.
				For example, <a href="https://www.velut.co.uk/domini-"><q lang="la">dominī</q></a> should rhyme with <q lang="la">hominī</q> and <a href="https://www.velut.co.uk/domi.ni-"><q lang="la">domínī</q></a> should rhyme with <q lang="la">inī</q>, <q lang="la">linī</q>, <q lang="la">Tarquinī</q>, <q lang="la">ratiōcinī</q>, etc.
				(Words don’t get an acute when there’s no other way of stressing them.)
			</p>

			<p>
				Because I’ve put this disambiguation code in the Node-only section, it won’t run in the browser.
				So if you input <samp>[{"Lemma": "dominus", "PartOfSpeech": "Noun"}, {"Lemma": "dominium", "PartOfSpeech": "Noun"}]</samp> in <a href="#textarea-input">the field above</a>, the output will be the correct forms of the two nouns, but with no acute accent. 
			</p>

			<h3>Checking the output in Node</h3>

			<p>
				I can also use Node to check the output against the forms I had in Excel.
				The code for this check is at <a href="https://github.com/DuncanRitchie/velut-inflector/blob/14bca4d1d67b0ef5aa71d37f1b29bbbb230b16ca/inflector.js#L4882">the end of inflector.js</a>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Excitingly, <em>all</em> the forms in Excel (and therefore all the forms currently on the velut website) are getting generated by the Inflector.
				(Mistakes in the Excel forms are replicated by the Inflector, but labelled <code>"incorrect"</code> so I’ll easily filter them out.)
			</p>

			<h3>Testing in the browser</h3>

			<p>
				If you’re not me, you won’t have access to all the input data, nor will you have access to the data from Excel that I compare the output to in Node. But you can <a href="#testing">run some tests</a> yourself in your browser’s console by clicking the “Run tests” button above. These tests run the Inflector code against some lemmata.
			</p>

			<h3>My workflow for managing velut</h3>

			<p>
				The Inflector can generate forms for every lemma in my collection, and I can now say I’m happy with those forms.
				All the forms are now visible on the velut website.
				You can search (or follow a link) for any of them, they’re in the lists of rhymes (etc) on the site, and they’re in the inflection-tables for the lemmata on the site.
			</p>

			<p>
				I have little use for the Excel file now.
				Everything is getting derived from my Json data.
				This also makes it easier for me to add lemmata to velut, or delete lemmata from it, since I’ll be editing the Json and not Excel.
			</p>

			<p>
				(I haven’t actually made any edits to the Excel file since October 2022, when I started making the Inflector.
				Any edits would need to be replicated in the new architecture.)
			</p>

			<p>
				So, to refresh the data in velut, I run the Inflector, which creates the inflected forms for all my lemmata.
				Next, I run a script called the <a href="https://www.duncanritchie.co.uk/velut-lemmata-collator">Lemmata Collator</a>, which extracts all the inflected forms into a convenient list of words with the lemmata each word is a form of.
				Then, I run my <a href="https://www.duncanritchie.co.uk/velut-word-data-generator">Word Data Generator</a> script, which produces information that the website needs about each word.
				Finally, I import the data into the MongoDB database, for the website to read from when you browse.
			</p>

			<p>
				To sum up, my long-term project has been to convert my Excel file into websites and webpages that are easier to share and maintain.
				I’ve been very much in a transition period of using the Excel file for some things and my newer websites/webpages for others.
				But the Inflector is another step in the process.
				The whole velut project was very convoluted; with my new scripts, it’s not as bad.
			</p>

			<p>
				For more information, I have a <a href="https://www.velut.co.uk/deexcellation">page about “de-Excellation”</a> on velut, with statistics that update themselves whenever I refresh my local database with the Inflector’s output.
				And on GitHub I have a <a href="https://github.com/DuncanRitchie/velut/blob/main/plan.md">checklist of steps</a> that I am working through.
				For an overview of velut in general, see the <a href="https://github.com/DuncanRitchie/velut/blob/main/README.md">“readme” file</a>.
				Or you can just go to the <a href="https://www.velut.co.uk">velut website</a> and see what Latin words are there!
